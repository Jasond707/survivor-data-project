# Survivor Data Analysis Project

This project explores data from the TV show *Survivor* to better understand what kinds of people get cast and what traits lead to success. I used Python and pandas to clean, analyze, and visualize the data in a Jupyter Notebook.

## What I Looked At

- What traits winners tend to have (age, gender, profession, state)
- Casting trends across all contestants
- Whether returning players do better than first-timers
- Fun facts: most appearances, youngest/oldest players, and more

---

## Key Insights

- Winners are slightly older than the average contestant
- CBS casts men and women in almost equal numbers
- Returning players don’t always do better — but fan favorites come back sometimes
- California produces the most contestants and winners
- A few players have won more than once
